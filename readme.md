# Castor Canadensis
A MacOS Menu Bar App.

Created to simplyfy my Menu Bar, along with being the first real project that I've finished.

## Menu Items

**Toggle Default Browser**: Runs a python script that uses PyAutoGUI to control mouse movement to switch the default browser from Safari to Firefox and vice-versa. 

**Default Browser: [Safari/Firefox]**: Displays the default browser that is being used. Only updates through using Castor Canadensis, as it does not actually detect the default browser.
  
**Desk Lamp On / Off**: Runs an Apple shortcut to turn on/off a smart outlet that powers the lamp next to my desk.

**Clear Downlaods**: Runs an Apple shortcut to move the items from the Downloads folder to an archived Download folder.

**About**: Displays the about menu for the Application, using the MacOS about menu.

**Quit**: Stops the application from runnign.

## The Name
*Castor Canadensis* is the scientific name for the North American Beaver, Canada's national animal. The scientific name comes from "Castor", the latin word for beaver, and "Canadensis" comes from the Latinized version of Canada.
